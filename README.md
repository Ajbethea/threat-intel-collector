\# Threat Intel Collector (Beginner API Project)
> 🧠 Automate threat intel lookups using public APIs and flag malicious IPs — built for SOC analysts, cybersecurity students, and blue teamers.



This project is a simple, real-world style security automation tool.



It reads IP addresses from a CSV file (`findings.csv`), queries public threat intelligence APIs, and outputs an enriched CSV (`findings\_enriched.csv`) with a `malicious` flag and supporting intel fields.



\## What it Does



\- Ingests IPs from `findings.csv`

\- Queries:

&nbsp; - AbuseIPDB (`/api/v2/check`)

&nbsp; - AlienVault OTX (`/api/v1/indicators/IPv4/{ip}/general`)

\- Enriches each IP with:

&nbsp; - `abuseipdb\_score`

&nbsp; - `abuseipdb\_reports`

&nbsp; - `otx\_pulses`

&nbsp; - `malicious` (True/False based on simple rules)

&nbsp; - Error fields (e.g. `otx\_error`) when APIs time out or fail

\- Writes results to `findings\_enriched.csv`



\## Tech \& Skills Demonstrated



\- Python 3 (3.11+)

\- `requests` for HTTP calls

\- Working with CSVs (`csv.DictReader` / `DictWriter`)

\- Consuming threat intel APIs

\- Handling timeouts and API errors gracefully

\- Basic threat intelligence enrichment logic



\## Project Files



\- `threat\_checker.py`  

&nbsp; Main script that:

&nbsp; - Reads `findings.csv`

&nbsp; - Calls AbuseIPDB / OTX (if API keys are set)

&nbsp; - Applies malicious logic

&nbsp; - Outputs `findings\_enriched.csv`



\- `findings.csv`  

&nbsp; Sample input file with test IPs.



\- `findings\_enriched.csv`  

&nbsp; Example enriched output (can be regenerated by running the script).



\- `api\_sample\_output.json`  

&nbsp; Static sample of what enriched data can look like without exposing real keys.



\## Setup



1\. Install dependencies:



&nbsp;  ```bash

&nbsp;  pip install requests
